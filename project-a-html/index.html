  <h3>Course Description</h3>

  <p>Creative Coding Lab explores the fundamentals of computer programming and web development through a series of
    creative projects. The course aims to equip students with the skills to develop web-based applications that use the
    JavaScript language and the p5.js environment and include a significant computational component. Fundamental
    concepts, such as variables, functions, control flow, arrays, loops and object-oriented programming, are applied to
    create generative visuals, interactive experiences, and internet art projects. This course is intended for students
    with no prior programming experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Course Overview and Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <p>Creative Coding Lab is structured in two phases, each of which ends with a larger project (“Project A” and “Project
    B”). In the first phase, students are using exclusively p5.js and are introduced to new programming concepts week by
    week. The second phase expands the purview to more broadly deal with the crafting of creative applications on the
    web - including modules about HTML, CSS, and media.
    To further familiarize each week’s learning, students work on a “Mini Project” that is introduced during recitation
    and usually due in the next class.
    The creative themes of the projects challenge students to think about subjects such as interactivity, generative
    patterns, reusability of code, or interfaces while creating drawing tools, designing imaginary creatures, building
    interactive photo booths, and more. </p>
  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Practice and produce the fundamentals of programming, focusing on</li>
    <li>variables, values, and variable mutation;</li>
    <li>data types, operators, and expressions;</li>
    <li>procedural statements — assignments, conditionals, and iterations (loops);</li>
  </ul>
